# Jamming

## Description

This is a React app that I created during my Front-End Developer course on Codecademy. The goal was to connect the App with the Spotify API and make the Users able to search songs, create a new playlist and upload it to Spotify.

## Features

- Login: if the Users try to search for a song, Spotify will ask them to login or create a new account.
- Search: once logged in, the Users can search for songs on Spotify via Jamming.
- Create a new list: The Users can add or remove songs to/from their list. They can also name this new list.
- Save list: the Users can add the newly created list to their Spotify account.
- The Users can check and modify their existing lists.
